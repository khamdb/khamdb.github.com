<h2>OVA for Flowplayer - No or Incorrect Duration Examples</h2>
<h3>1. Always forcing Show Duration from Metadata</h3>
<p class="example">
</p>
01: <a href="force/example01.html">Forcing show duration to be taken from the clip metadata</a>
<br/>
<h3>1. The Duration-less Ad Stream Tests</h3>
<p class="example">
In the following cases, either an ad does not have a duration provided in the VAST response
or the duration specified varies from the value extracted from the stream meta data. In
each case, the duration is changed to reflect the correct value and the tracking points
are updated accordingly.
</p>
01: <a href="ads/example01.html">A duration-less stream with a pre-roll that does not have a VAST duration</a>
<br/>
02: <a href="ads/example02.html">A duration-less stream with a pre-roll with an incorrect VAST duration</a>
<br/>
03: <a href="ads/example03.html">Leaving the original VAST duration untouched</a>
<br/>
<p>
<h3>2. The Duration-less Show Stream Tests</h3>
<p class="example">
In all of the following cases, the show streams do not have a duration specified. This automatically puts 
the OAS into "duration-less" mode. "duration-less" mode can be forciby activated by using the
"setDurationFromMetaData" shows configuration parameter in the "shows" config group. This will force
the stream metadata value to override any specified duration value.
